***MAIN OBJECTIVE***

For our final year research project, we plan to build a school management system that facilitates the academic and administrative work of a school. 
Primarily we focus on schools in Sri Lanka. This is similar to a typical e-learning system, but there is something beyond e-learning here. 

Mainly we cover 4 scopes.

Firstly, students can predict the marks they will get in the respective subjects in the next semester or in the next exam. 
Teachers/Advisers able to be Specifying the student's desired grade or marks for each module or subject in the upcoming semester. 

At present, written examinations are in high demand for assessing the subject matter. 
But with the advancement of technology there are new means of assessment methodologies available in the world. 
Here the system can predict a personalized assessment methodology and analyze studentâ€™s future plans and future paths based on their performance and progress.

Considering the learning strategies, rather than teaching a student with a pre-defined set of subjects, there should be a way to identify beforehand the potential 
expert subject area of the student. Farming a student/s for a classroom/s with a tutor/s could affect in a negative way a student who is highly engageable and active. 
Furthermore, there are students who find it difficult to provide written solutions to a problem but find it easy and engaging to verbally express the answer with 
real-world scenarios. 

Due to the long education path of a student, it is difficult to track and provide analyzed/accurate solutions to the above problems with current utilizing means.

Main objective of the research is to develop AI based Smart Assistive Platform to Provide Detailed Analysis on Student Education on their Learning Patterns.

***INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH QUESTION***

***Analysis the student's expected grade or marks for the following semester/term.***

Normally variables such as students' communication skills, personal skills, and study hours used  to get an overall idea about an individual student 
but here uses the major variable student subject mark because it is an ideal parameter for fine-tune personalized marks.

Questions

1. What data do you currently collect, and track related to student marks?
2. What do you currently do with this data, and what challenges do you face in using it to make predictions about student marks?
3. What would you like to be able to do with a student mark prediction model, and what outcomes are you hoping to see?


***Analysis of student performance and prediction of the best assessment approach.***

This will predict the best-suited assessment methodology for the student. Along with that main objective, also it will perform a full analysis of the student 
while allowing users to get insights into the student by a given analysis report. In order to cater to this requirement, this component will track how much time, 
the student is exposed to that course content and assess the student with relevant course content continuously. Here, students can engage in predefined online assessments 
that are used to evaluate them, and the best assessment method is predicted based on each student's current progress and performance. Assessment data is gathered and 
analyzed in order to assess student learning progress and predict student interests and future paths.

***Prediction of the most suited subject Stream achievement information of a particular student.***

As study content, educational systems will only provide subject materials and some relative assessment methods. Although every person is an expert in at least one particular area, 
that area may change from time to time. Educational systems will not provide the subject that each individual is an expert in. In this module, the expert subject area of 
the student is identified by considering some factors of his or her studies and background as well. 

Questions

1.	Can you describe the process you use to assess a student's strengths and interests in a subject area?
2.	How do you help students choose an appropriate subject for their future academic or career path?
3.	How do you advise students who are torn between two or more subject areas they are passionate about?
4.	How do you motivate and support students who may be struggling with a particular subject they have chosen?
5.	Can you share any strategies or resources you use to help students who are considering changing their subject area of focus?
6.	How do you encourage students to pursue their passions and pursue their chosen subject areas at a deeper level?

***Analysis the best suited learning plan and the subject scope for the student.***

Most systems only provide students with predefined subject theories and learning plans. However, this module will predict the best suitable learning plan or 
subject scope and theories for the student, assisting in the improvement of their educational manner and identifying the best approach to the learning plan in 
a systematic manner. 

Questions

1.	Can you describe the process you use to determine the individual learning needs and goals of each student?
2.	How do you assess a student's strengths and weaknesses to determine the best learning plan for them?
3.	How do you involve the students in the decision-making process for selecting a learning plan?
4.	How do you ensure that the subject scope you choose for a student is both challenging and appropriate for their abilities?
5.	How do you differentiate instruction to meet the needs of diverse learners in your classroom?
6.	How do you measure the success of a student's learning plan, and what steps do you take to make modifications as needed?
